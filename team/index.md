### History

Grape was created by [Michael Bleigh](https://github.com/mbleigh) at [Intridea](http://www.intridea.com/) and [made its debut at RubyConf 2010 in New Orleans](http://confreaks.tv/videos/rubyconf2010-the-grapes-of-rapid). [Jerry Cheung](https://github.com/jch) had later joined development. Grape left the Intridea home on August 3rd, 2015 and became an independent project that belongs to the Ruby community. Today Grape is maintained by [Daniel Doubrovkine](https://github.com/dblock) and consists of [numerous projects](/projects), each individually maintained by a growing group that is defined by rough concensus and running code. Grape is used by many thousands of developers and numerous commercial and non-commercial applications. [Grape itself](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape) had 6,462 stars and 726 forks on Github as of August 3rd, 2015.

### Participating in the Grape Community

We welcome all contributors to the Grape ecosystem, built upon rough consensus and running code, a principle described in the [Tao of IETF](https://www.ietf.org/tao.html). We are highly inclusive, try to be nice and helpful to both experienced and new developers. We encourage you to participate and to be pragmatic. To quote David Clark, _"We reject kings, presidents and voting"_, and Jon Postel, _"Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you accept."_
