Welcome to the new Ruby Grape organization.

### New Home

Please bookmark [github.com/ruby-grape](https://github.com/ruby-grape).

### Mailing List

We will continue to use [the Ruby-Grape Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ruby-grape) for all communication.

### Member Projects

The first two member projects are [grape](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape) itself and [grape-entity](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape-entity), moving here from [intridea](https://github.com/intridea).

### Governance

The new ruby-grape is owned by the community and is built around rough concensus and working code.

The organization will be grown with an increasing number of maintainers, including some promoted to organizational admin level. We begin by welcoming [Daniel Doubrovkine, @dblock](https://github.com/dblock) (currently serving as CTO at [Artsy.net](https://www.artsy.net) in New York City) and [Michael Bleigh, @mbleigh](https://github.com/mbleigh), CEO of [DivShot](https://divshot.com) as organizational admins.

### This Site

The newly remodeled [ruby-grape.github.io](http://ruby-grape.github.io) is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Github pages](https://pages.github.com). The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ruby-grape/ruby-grape.github.io). We welcome grape-related posts and announcements.

### A Huge Thank You

We'd like to send a *huge thank you* to all the contributors to the Grape ecosystem. This is the beginning of a bright future!
